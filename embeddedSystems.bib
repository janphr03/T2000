	abstract = {Embedded Systems Architecture is a practical and technical guide to understanding the components that make up an embedded system\&\#39;s architecture. This book is perfect for those starting out as technical professionals such as engineers, programmers and designers of embedded systems; and also for students of computer science, computer engineering and electrical engineering. It gives a much-needed \&\#39;big picture\&\#39; for recently graduated engineers grappling with understanding the design of real-world systems for the first time, and provides professionals with a systems-level picture of the key elements that can go into an embedded design, providing a firm foundation on which to build their skills. - Real-world approach to the fundamentals, as well as the design and architecture process, makes this book a popular reference for the daunted or the inexperienced: if in doubt, the answer is in here! - Fully updated with new coverage of {FPGAs}, testing, middleware and the latest programming techniques in C, plus complete source code and sample code, reference designs and tools online make this the complete package - Visit the companion web site at http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780123821966/ for source code, design examples, data sheets and more - A true introductory book, provides a comprehensive get up and running reference for those new to the field, and updating skills: assumes no prior knowledge beyond undergrad level electrical engineering - Addresses the needs of practicing engineers, enabling it to get to the point more directly, and cover more ground. Covers hardware, software and middleware in a single volume - Includes a library of design examples and design tools, plus a complete set of source code and embedded systems design tutorial materials from companion website},
